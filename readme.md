# TorqueScout 3

The Texas Torque Scouting Application for Remix.
Testing for the 2023 season.

## TorqueScout 4

TorqueScout 4 will be an improved version implemented to:

- Support the 2023 game.
- Have an improved, more scalable login system under the hood.
- More advanced analysis tools.

## Architecture

The frontend uses React.JS and is hosted using Netlify.
The backend is handled entirely through FireBase.
Why? Security isn't that big of an concern.
If it was we would route requests through our own server.
Maybe we'll add this.
