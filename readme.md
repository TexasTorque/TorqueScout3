Was made in **6.5** hours.

## Architecture

The frontend uses React.JS and is hosted using Netlify.
The backend is handled entirely through FireBase.
Why? Security isn't that big of an concern.
If it was we would route requests through our own server.

## Todo

Market Deco follow naming convention.
